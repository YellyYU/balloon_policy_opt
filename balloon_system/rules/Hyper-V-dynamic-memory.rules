### Main script
# Methodology: The goal is to shrink all guests fairly and by an amount
# scaled to the level of host memory pressure.  If the host is under
# severe pressure, scale back more aggressively.  We don't yet handle
# symptoms of over-ballooning guests or try to balloon idle guests more
# aggressively.  When the host is not under memory pressure, slowly
# deflate the balloons.
